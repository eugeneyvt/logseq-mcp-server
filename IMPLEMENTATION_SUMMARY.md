## ✅ **Complete Feature Implementation**

### 1. **Enhanced Search Tool** - The Powerhouse

**Single tool handles all discovery needs:**

- **Templates**: `templates:*` (list all), `template:"Meeting Template"` (specific)
- **Properties**: `property:status=open`, `properties:page="Project Alpha"`
- **Relations**: `backlinks:"Important Page"`, `references:"Research Topic"`
- **Dates**: `date:2024-01-01`, `date:today`, `date:last-week`, `date:last-month`
- **Smart Patterns**: `"empty"` (empty pages), `"*"` (all pages)
- **Combined Filters**: `property:status=open AND date:last-week`, `templates:* OR property:type=template`

### 2. **Complete Property Management** - Enhanced Existing Tool

**`set_page_properties` now handles everything:**

- **Query Mode**: Call without parameters to get current properties
- **CRUD Operations**: Upsert/remove properties in one call
- **Validation**: Property type checking and formatting
- **Fallback**: Block-based updates if API fails

### 3. **Template System** - New Tool #1: `apply_template`

**Single tool for all template operations:**

- **Discovery**: `templateName: "*"` lists all available templates
- **Application**: Apply with variable substitution (`{{projectName}}` → "My Project")
- **Modes**: Replace, append, or prepend content
- **Validation**: Placeholder detection and structure analysis

### 4. **Enhanced Page Retrieval** - Supercharged Existing Tool

**`get_page` now returns comprehensive relationship data:**

- **Backlinks**: Pages that reference this page (with reference counts)
- **Outgoing Links**: Pages this page references
- **Related Pages**: AI-suggested related content with relevance scores
- **Metrics**: Connection counts and relationship analysis

### 5. **Relationship Management** - New Tool #2: `manage_relations`

**Single tool for all relationship operations:**

- **Link Creation**: `operation: "create-link"` with bi-directional references
- **Link Removal**: `operation: "remove-link"` cleans both directions
- **Analysis**: `operation: "analyze-relations"` provides graph analysis
- **Structure**: `operation: "get-graph-structure"` shows connectivity patterns

### 6. **Safety Controls** - Enhanced Destructive Operations

**All destructive operations now require explicit confirmation:**

- **Confirmation Required**: `confirmDestroy: true` prevents accidents
- **Dry Run Enhanced**: Detailed previews of what will be deleted/changed
- **Context Awareness**: Shows page content, block counts, relationships before deletion

## 🛠 **Technical Architecture**

### Modular Design Maintained

```
src/handlers/
├── search-handlers.ts      # Enhanced with 5 new query types
├── template-handlers.ts    # New: Template operations
├── relation-handlers.ts    # New: Relationship management
├── page/
│   ├── get-page.ts        # Enhanced with relationship data
│   ├── set-page-properties.ts # Complete implementation
│   └── delete-page.ts     # Enhanced safety controls
└── core-methods.ts        # Orchestrates all modules
```

### Query Intelligence Examples

```javascript
// Template Operations
search({ q: 'templates:*' }); // List all templates
apply_template({
  templateName: 'Meeting Template',
  targetPage: 'Team Standup 2024-01-15',
  variables: { date: '2024-01-15', team: 'Engineering' },
});

// Property Operations
search({ q: 'property:status=open' }); // Find open tasks
search({ q: 'properties:page="Project Alpha"' }); // Get all properties
set_page_properties({ name: 'Task 1', upsert: { status: 'completed' } });

// Relationship Operations
search({ q: 'backlinks:"Important Topic"' }); // Find referencing pages
manage_relations({
  operation: 'create-link',
  sourcePage: 'Research',
  targetPage: 'Implementation',
  linkText: 'leads to',
});

// Enhanced Page Retrieval
get_page({ name: 'Project Overview' });
// Returns: page data + backlinks + outgoing links + related pages + metrics
```
